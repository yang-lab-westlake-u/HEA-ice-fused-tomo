Description

We first use the method proposed by Jonathan et al. [1] to perform 2D fusion of the registered and denoised EDS_HAADF with EDS_mapping. Then, we apply the approach from [2] to conduct 3D fused multi-modal reconstruction, fusing the STEM_HAADF projections with the EDS_mapping obtained from the 2D fusion process.
